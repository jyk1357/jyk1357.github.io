    <p>
        Bootstrap components on each page<br>
        &emsp; Make your main index.html page a meaningful splash page for the purposes of your site. 
        Maybe you're making a personal portfolio, maybe you're creating a site dedicated to 
        some specific aspect of your research, whatever.<br>
        &emsp; A combination of images and text would be ideal.<br>
        &emsp; Continue work on your navigation elements so that they display 
        well on each page.<br>
        &emsp; Begin to develop the look and feel for your site. 
        This means an intentional use of color and font throughout.<br>
        &emsp; Get rid of any extraneous features that may have been added by a VS Code 
        template (search boxes that aren't active, etc.).<br>
        &emsp; The idea is for you to continue work on a site entirely of your own creation 
        and not the result of any preconfigured and downloaded template.<br>
        &emsp; You can use the basic starter template from the Bootstrap documentation site; 
        but do not use a full-featured template downloaded from a tutorial or other source online. 
        You should be creating a site from HTML, CSS, and JS files you create in VS Code.<br>
        &emsp; Make sure the site is responsive, i.e. displays appropriately on various screen sizes.<br>
        &emsp; You might consider adding a Digital Chalkboard page, or at least a Sandbox page 
        where you can experiment with JavaScript functions and other tasks we do in class.<br>

        A function that displays the current minute of the day<br>
        &emsp; Create a div that starts out as blank.<br>
        &emsp; Write a function that displays the current minute in the div.<br>
        &emsp; The minute must be determined dynamically using a new Date() object.<br>
        &emsp; Provide a button to retrieve the minute and add it to the innerText of the div.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A button that when clicked makes an element disappear<br>
        &emsp; Write a function that gets an element by Id.<br>
        &emsp; Save that element as a variable.<br>
        &emsp; Use the .style method to change the display to none.<br>
        &emsp; The button should invoke this function.<br>
        &emsp; The outcome is that a click on the button hides the element.<br>
        &emsp; NOTE: we haven't seen this precise example yet, so feel free to reach out to each
        other on Slack for help.<br>
